# LinguaForge

ðŸš€ **A FastAPI-based translation tool powered by MarianMT models from Hugging Face.**  

This project is an educational endeavor to explore deploying open-source machine learning models (specifically MarianMT for translation) using FastAPI. It serves as a learning experience for working with Hugging Face models, FastAPI, and deploying machine learning systems.  

While the project is still in development, it currently supports translation using MarianMT models and can be extended with a frontend or CLI interface in the future.  

---

## Features  
- **Translation using MarianMT**: Leverage Hugging Face's MarianMT models for fast and accurate translations.  
- **FastAPI Backend**: A lightweight and efficient API for handling translation requests.  
- **Educational Focus**: Learn how to deploy open-source models, use FastAPI, and integrate with Hugging Face.  
- **Extensible**: Designed to be extended with a frontend or CLI interface (future work).
